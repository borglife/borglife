## For seasoned data scientists 
DataRobot provides a growing library of the latest algorithms and pre-built prototypes for feature extraction and data preparation. It also provides automated ensembling, allowing them to easily select and combine multiple algorithms to rapidly produce more accurate predictive models. 

## For business data analysts 
For business analysts and new data scientists, DataRobot assures best data science practices by automating the selection of the best features, algorithms, and parameter values for building each model, and so eliminating the need for trial-and-error guesswork. 

## For Executives 
DataRobot reduces the risk, cost, and time to value in the adoption and expansion of predictive analytics for faster, better decisions. It does this by making machine learning simpler and faster, and by optimising scarce and costly data science skills. 


# Our Platform
Robotica is committed to providing robust and scalable solutions for every customer. We know that each customer is different, which is why all of our solutions are too. Projects within the same organisation may or many not share technologies, infrastructure and processes; the business objectives may be very different and necessitate contrasting approaches and solutions. There is always a balance between speed to market, accuracy, flexibility, longevity and clarity of result. Our truly agile process enables us to discover how to apply that balance, seeking out and embracing changing requirements so as to deliver a well-fitting solution.
