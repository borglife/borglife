## For seasoned data scientists 
DataRobot provides a growing library of the latest algorithms and pre-built prototypes for feature extraction and data preparation. It also provides automated ensembling, allowing them to easily select and combine multiple algorithms to rapidly produce more accurate predictive models. 

## For business data analysts 
For business analysts and new data scientists, DataRobot assures best data science practices by automating the selection of the best features, algorithms, and parameter values for building each model, and so eliminating the need for trial-and-error guesswork. 

## For Executives 
DataRobot reduces the risk, cost, and time to value in the adoption and expansion of predictive analytics for faster, better decisions. It does this by making machine learning simpler and faster, and by optimising scarce and costly data science skills. 


# Allied Machine Learning
Robotica is committed to providing robust and scalable solutions for every customer. We know that each customer is different, which is why all of our solutions are too. Projects within the same organisation may or many not share technologies, infrastructure and processes; the business objectives may be very different and necessitate contrasting approaches and solutions. There is always a balance between speed to market, accuracy, flexibility, longevity and clarity of result. Our truly agile process enables us to discover how to apply that balance, seeking out and embracing changing requirements so as to deliver a well-fitting solution.


## A fine idea in a fine city
Robotica Machine Learning is a small software development consultancy based out of Norwich in the heart of Norfolk, UK.  Robotica was founded by [Adrian Pickering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianpickering/){:target="_blank"} for the purpose of bringing advances from the relatively mature world of computer science to the brave new world of data science.  We have the core aim of making the act of out-sourcing software development projects transparent, honest and straightforward.


## Straightforward how?
It's all about respect.

Any consultancy will insist that they are customer focussed, but do they really put you at the centre of every decision?  How might that manifest?  With every interaction, we pursue a win-win outcome. We operate on the footing of scheduled, measurable customer success criteria - agreeing outcomes in advance.  

Robotica won't sell to you, we partner with you. This means that the each process is bespoke; as much yours as it is ours. We work together on shared milestones and objectives.  The work we undertake is priced according to agreed value.  We have no incentive to cut corners or to string out time and materials billing.  We recognise that needs change as part of our commitment.

**Working with Robotica is architected to be the easiest choice you will make and one you will not regret.**


## What's wrong with data science?
Data science is an exciting field and it is not hyperbole to say that the outputs are fundamentally transforming the way business operates. Far beyond robotic process automation, predictive AI empowers organisations to automate a broad range of analyses - [from inventory management to fraud analysis to custom pricing](https://robotica.ml/posts/opportunities.html).  At a very high level, the workflow for this involves problem discovery and analysis, gathering and shaping data, designing and crafting computational models, putting them into production and using them.  This really is not so far removed from the way computer software projects have historically been managed.  Data science programmes are now fighting the same battles which are only now being won in computer science: over-running projects that don't keep up with requirements and are seldom deployed to be exploited by end users.

Over the last twenty years, the rise of agile methodologies for frequent, iterative delivery of working product, has emerged to empower organisations and delivered ongoing value against an ever-changing landscape. The cycle time for turning ideas into software in the hands of users has been reduced from months or years to days or hours.  Automated testing and deployment makes this possible.  Robotica Machine Learning extends these processes into tooling to bring comparable benefits to automate machine learning.  We have concentrated our efforts on understanding the [reasons why many data science programmes end in the lab](https://robotica.ml/posts/reasons-why-many-data-science-programmes-end-in-the-lab) and engineering robust solutions to the underlying causes.


## DataRobot and Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services
Gartner recognises DataRobot and Microsoft as visionaries in the [Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms](https://blog.datarobot.com/datarobot-included-for-the-first-time-as-a-visionary-in-the-2019-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-platforms){:target="_blank"}.  We are proud partners, integrating these best-of-breed stacks directly into your systems and processes, extending their benefits with continuous integration, continuous delivery and human-readable, automated governance rules and fitness functions.  We believe that nobody offers a more complete picture, helping you to realise your machine learning ambitions quickly, robustly and with longevity.


## What is automated machine learning?
Automated machine learning has become a loaded term. Drag-and-drop applications offer improved user experience but demand substantial commitment, technical understanding and effort from data scientists and engineers.  Our fully automated machine learning pipelines continue to learn and deploy, growing and improving alongside your data.  We go further: rather than retraining models on new data, we automate complete redesigns of new models, unassisted, explained and governed to meet your compliance demands.  Bespoke software is an investment and it should offer compound value.
